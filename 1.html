    <p>Hi, people watching this web. I am Lee Kwan Ho who lives in South Korea. 
    On November 17, 2022, I was in a position not to go to the university I wanted 
    because I didn't get good grades on the exam, the most important test for entering college in Korea.
    So after the college entrance exam, I don't want to just play in my free time, but I'm making a web 
    with HTml because I'm wondering if there's anything that'll help me in my life.
    To be honest, before I took the CSAT, I thought I could get good grades and go to the university I wanted, but it wasn't as easy as I thought. I said I'll do my best.
    I tried to pretend to be happy because I was nosy with my friends before taking the CSAT, but even that was not easy.
    There's nowhere to lament, so I'm writing here. </p>
